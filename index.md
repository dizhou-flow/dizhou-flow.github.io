## Short Biography
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/">Department of Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/"> Vanderbilt University</a>, working with Prof. <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/glennwebb/">Glenn Webb</a> on Mathematical Biology. Before coming to Vandy, I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://acms.nd.edu/people/bei-hu/">Bei Hu</a>. Prior to that, I received an M.S., a B.S., and a B.Econ from <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn/">Renmin University</a> of China. My research interests are in mathematical biology and partial differential equations(PDEs), and my recent work involves both theoretical and numerical analysis of various  free boundary problems which have real-world applications such as tumor growth and atherosclerosis.

## Short Biography
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/math/">Department of Mathematics at <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/"> Vanderbilt University, working with Prof. <a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/glennwebb/">Glenn Webb on Mathematical Biology. Before coming to Vandy, I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://acms.nd.edu/people/bei-hu/">Bei Hu. Prior to that, I received an M.S., a B.S., and a B.Econ from <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn/">Renmin University of China. My research interests are in mathematical biology and partial differential equations(PDEs), and my recent work involves both theoretical and numerical analysis of various free boundary problems which have real-world applications such as tumor growth and atherosclerosis.

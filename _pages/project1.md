It is well known that turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) under adverse pressure gradient are very common in a lot of engineering applications and are often related to the off-design conditions of engineering devices. An improved understanding of the underlying flow physics can be beneficial to the design as well as optimization of engineering devices, and it is also a prerequisite to the development of effective flow control strategies.

In order to investigate the evolution of axisymmetric TBL in the presence of adverse pressure gradient, the turbulent flow over an axisymmetric body of revolution (BOR) at zero angle of attack is computed using large-eddy simulation (LES). The BOR consists of an ellipsoidal nose, a cylindrical midsection and a 20-degrees tail cone. The Reynolds number based on the free-stream velocity and the BOR length is 1.9 million. Based on the flow-field data from LES, the effects of adverse pressure gradient on the evolution of TBL statistical properties and the change in the flow structures over the tail cone are analyzed. In addition, the applicability of the embedded shear layer scaling in the axisymmetric boundary layer on the tail cone and the space‚Äêtime characteristics of pressure fluctuations on the tail cone surface are investigated.

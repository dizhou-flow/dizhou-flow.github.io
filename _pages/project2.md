The interaction of a rotor with turbulent inflow is known to be a significant and often dominant source of noise in many engineering systems. An ability to predict the rotor noise and a clear understanding of the noise generation mechanisms are critical to the design and optimization of rotor in engineering devices.

In collaboration with an experimental team from Virginia Tech, I am investigating the generation of noise from a five-bladed rotor ingesting a thick TBL at the tail end of an axisymmetric body of revolution. The noise of rotor-boundary layer interaction is computed using LES and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. The calculated far-field sound pressure spectra show broadband turbulence ingestion noise with haystacking spectral peaks near the blade passing frequency and its first three harmonics, which compares well with the experimental data. Based on the flow and sound data from the simulations, the properties of rotor blade acoustic source including the source strength distribution, correlations and their relationships to the turbulent flow field are investigated. The simulation data have also been used to check the validity of Sears theory in predicting the turbulence ingestion noise of rotor.

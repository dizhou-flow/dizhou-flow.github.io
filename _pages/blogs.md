#### US national parks tier list 
Over the past seven years, I have traveled through 29 states (staying at least one night in each) and visited 29 national parks across the United States. Based on these experiences, I've created a tier list to share my personal ratings of the national parks I've visited. This tier system is deeply personal and subjective, reflecting not an absolute ranking, but rather my own experiences and preferences. Due to time and resource constraints, I haven't been able to explore every aspect of these parks; thus, my rankings are based solely on what I've personally seen and done. Please consider this tier system as a reflection of my own journey through America's national parks, shaped by the landscapes that resonate most deeply with me. As I continue to visit more national parks, I will update this list to reflect those experiences. 

My appreciation for scenery strongly influences my ratingsâ€”mountains are my favorite, followed by deserts, then seashores or lakeshores, with caves next, and forests being relatively my least favorite. The scale of the scenery plays a critical role in my evaluations, and the diversity of the landscape is also an important consideration. I also place significant emphasis on the opportunity to observe wildlife. However, factors like park facilities or crowd levels do not weigh heavily in my criteria.



1, S Tier (Must-See Landmarks): These are the crown jewels of national parks according to my experiences. They offer breathtaking landscapes that are often iconic representations of natural beauty in the U.S. If your time in the U.S. is limited, these parks provide unforgettable experiences that define the majesty of the country's wilderness.

2, A Tier (Exceptional Destinations): Parks in this tier boast exceptional views and experiences that merit a special trip. Ideal for those spending an extended period in the U.S., these parks offer a blend of majestic scenery and unique natural features that are well worth exploring in-depth. Each park has a distinct appeal that makes it a special destination.

3, B Tier (Worthy Detours): These parks are perfect for those traveling nearby and offer very good views or unique activities that justify a detour. While they might not command the awe of higher-tier parks, their beauty and recreational opportunities are significant enough to enhance any road trip or local adventure.

4, C Tier (Local Charms): While the scenery of these parks might be less amazing, they offer pleasing landscapes and are worth visiting if you are local or passing through the area. They might not be destinations to plan a trip around without other reasons to be nearby, but they can provide a delightful escape into nature.
